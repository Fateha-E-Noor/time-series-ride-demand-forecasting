# Dataset notes

This repository does NOT include the raw dataset (but the link is given from where you can get the dataset).

How to obtain the data:

1. If your instructor provided a dataset, place it under `data/` with the filename expected by the notebook.
2. If data is from an external source, download it and save the cleaned CSV as `data/ride_data.csv`. (I have used dataset from kaggle)

If you choose NOT to include the data in the repo, update `.gitignore` to keep `data/` untracked and add a short script (or notebook cell) to recreate or fetch data.
